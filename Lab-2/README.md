Solution:
---
First of all I add a system menu to my application with 3 items, I used AppendMenu():
  * Sound (when you click on this item, a sound can be heared);
  * Dialog Box (when you click on this item, appear a dialog box);
  * Exit( you can close this application by click on this item.<br/>

Also I added a scrollbar that changes background color(from violet to green and viceverse), and if you press the left button or right the color also changes.<br/>

I added a listbox, and if you click on some element from list you can remove it.

Also I added an icon to my application.
